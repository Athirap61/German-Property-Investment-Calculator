## Understanding the Calculations üìà

### Annuity Calculations

An annuity is a series of payments made at equal intervals. In property investment, understanding annuities can help you evaluate the cash flow from rental income. The app calculates the present value of future cash flows to give you a clearer picture of your investment.

### Depreciation

Depreciation is the reduction in value of your property over time. It‚Äôs essential for tax calculations. The app helps you understand how depreciation affects your overall investment returns and tax liabilities.

### Inflation Impact

Inflation can erode your purchasing power. The app allows you to simulate different inflation rates to see how they impact your investment over time. This is crucial for long-term planning.

### Loan and Mortgage Calculations

Understanding loans and mortgages is vital for property investment. The app includes tools to calculate monthly payments, total interest paid, and how these factors affect your cash flow.

### Tax Calculations

The app uses real tax data from Germany to provide accurate calculations. This includes property tax, income tax on rental income, and other relevant taxes.
